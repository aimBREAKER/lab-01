                Hi my name is Ashish Arora and I'm a CMPA student at Georgian College in Barrie City of Ontario
                Province.
                It's not been much time that I've started this program in this college. Prior to this I recently
                completed my grade 12 with Physics Chemistry and Mathematics as majors among which i personally prefer
                Mathematics.
                There are certain things which I want to drop here. A book nerd who loves literature is knows is doing
                what in a computer and technology program.
                And as for the sake of computing and coding I have done a C++ certification course from a local
                institution back in my hometown.
            </p>

                I was born in the capital city of India. New delhi famously known as the Heart of India. Having lived
                amongst in a very diversied
                city which had people from every niche and corner of a country with population so huge it feels like
                you've been to the whole country despite living in a single city.
                That is what Delhi is all about , diversity , beauty and chaos. I recommend you to plan a trip to the
                over-populated yet gorgeous city.

                My schooling has been done from 2 schools which are literally on the ends of the table,obviously not on
                the same.
                I first studied in a private school near my house, technically what exciting would a 13 year old would
                do in a private school except kicking a ball in a field or being scolded by a teacher for not doing his
                hoemwork on time which technically still happens;)
                Now starts the exciting school life of a boy.
                He was idk for what reason thrwon into a boys only boarding school and ohH! man that wasa wild ride..
                wont say much but those 4 years made a sweet small 14 year old boy a tall bearded bullheaded guy.
                i guess thats enough
            </p>

                Achievements is something my life goes on a bit bumpy road.Not more than an average athelete most of my
                Achievementsand awards came out of literature and languages.
                I bagged various medals at different medals and certifications at differents levels
            </p>
            <p>I have a rather very simple and straight away goal of giving my parents a happy and peaceful life ahead</p>
